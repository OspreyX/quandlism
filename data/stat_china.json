Gross National Income (GNI) can be calculated on the basis of GDP on top of which is added the net factor income from the rest of the world.\n  Data on GDP and related indicators of the most recent year published in the Yearbook are not final and are subject to changes when more information from financial data and administrative records become available. \n  Where a census has been conducted, historical data of GDP of the previous years may also undergo change. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measurement of value which changes depending on changes of price and production. \n  GDP at constant prices converts the gross domestic product based on the current price into a value based on the price of the base period. When adjusted for price changes, the values of two different periods can be compared to reflect changes of both products and production activities. \n  GDP index is derived from the constant-price GDPs of the two periods. As economy grows, changes will take place in the price structures of various industries, and the base period for the measurement of constant-price GDP thus needs to be adjusted every few years in order to better reflect the impact of price change on the economy. \n  Since China started GDP calculation, eight constant-price base periods have been used, i.e., 1952, 1957, 1970, 1980, 1990,2000,ï¼Œ2005, and 2010 and the current base period is 2010. \n  That is to say, the 2011 GDP is calculated on the basis of the 2010 prices. As the calculation of constant-price GDP is based on different base periods, the constant-price GDP data in this yearbook shall also be announced in accordance with various periods.","updated_at":"2013-02-16T14:53:42Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Gross Domestic Product","Primary Industry","Secondary Industry","Industry","Tertiary Industry"],"private":false,"errors":{},"data":[["2011-12-31",100.0,4.6166014462836,51.641294260107,44.699638385849,43.742104293609],["2010-12-31",100.0,3.8485653447636,56.835771441799,48.538914032981,39.315663213437],["2009-12-31",100.0,4.4802057278668,51.944013749159,40.005398744023,43.575780522973],["2008-12-31",100.0,5.7309880672574,49.253607192311,43.39966981177,45.015404740432],["2007-12-31",100.0,2.9865231774587,50.69905257022,44.033478564206,46.314424252321],["2006-12-31",100.0,4.7816788555825,50.03645262442,42.417887959417,45.181868519998],["2005-12-31",100.0,5.6114059808373,51.114422597578,43.369243597843,43.274171421585],["2004-12-31",100.0,7.8593526052235,52.234190120386,47.73944360008,39.916457274391],["2003-12-31",100.0,3.3633268356949,58.511453712457,51.914634053736,38.125219451848],["2002-12-31",100.0,4.5655508980408,49.659083170244,44.448904167407,45.675365931715],["2001-12-31",100.0,5.0814401899363,46.697621276357,42.148903556534,48.220938533707],["2000-12-31",100.0,4.4301899092918,60.79807655749,57.628886213557,34.771733533219],["1999-12-31",100.0,5.9871284835342,57.768274887444,55.035040306831,36.244596629022],["1998-12-31",100.0,7.5832650704541,60.93586654858,55.397701648881,31.480868380966],["1997-12-31",100.0,6.7577463540199,59.734532436847,58.291726466288,33.517721209133],["1996-12-31",100.0,9.5627191190872,62.905761686349,58.488672037175,27.531519194564],["1995-12-31",100.0,9.073293519812699,64.339241811844,58.521201000933,26.587464668344],["1994-12-31",100.0,6.5915185746006,67.930205165828,62.597740603572,25.478276259572],["1993-12-31",100.0,7.8986479440251,65.46289231524,59.114093746176,26.638459740735],["1992-12-31",100.0,8.449481071520999,64.453152090991,57.587211318399,27.097366837488],["1991-12-31",100.0,7.1353849188822,62.801762114537,57.973568281938,30.06285296658],["1990-12-31",100.0,41.73993786483,41.038771031456,39.746403316264,17.321291103714]]}
